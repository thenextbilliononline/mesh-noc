# mesh-noc
This will be a stand-up mesh network operations center for new mesh locals to get up and go. Ideally the server infrastructre would be relatively independent (i.e. Wekan/BGP wouldn't have to be same device, but could be).

Infrastructure Required:  

[ ] ASN  
[ ] BGP Server  
[ ] DNS Server  
[ ] Tunneling Server  
[ ] Stand-up Website  
[ ] Cryptpad Server  
[ ] SMTP server  
[ ] Calendar Application  
[ ] Meet-up Page  
[ ] Volunteer intake  
[ ] Customer Relations management  
[ ] Rocket chat/ slack  
[ ] Wekan
  
Funding:

$400 ASN  
$100 ASN annual maintenance fee  
$4000 /24 IP address set  
$1000 Server Lab  
$900/year hosting fees  

RF-Lab:  

$500 (each) Lime-SDR (would want 2 X 3-piece kits for mesh testing, i.e. >6)  
$150 (each) Libre-Routers (>6, but can scale without bounds)  
$300 (each) battery kit for field testing (>2)  
$100 Cabling (ethernet cord, power cables, poe injectors)  
$300 managed network switch with arm processor  

Stipends:  

$20,000 for Organization, lawyers, LLC, and inter-mesh coordination  
$20,000 in sprint funds for developers in diaspora.  

Ongoing-costs:  

$$$$$ Labor  
$$$ Translation  
$1000/year VPS infrastructure  

Long-Term Funding Ideas:  

paid support for librerouters (requires different support model)  
grant funding (better as seed capital/not sustainable)  
member funding (enough to keep VPS going, no labor support)  
research grants (the big money--labor costs can be funded for new research)
