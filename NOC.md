## Overview
The Mesh-NOC aims to be a decentralized Network Operations Center providing mesh-locals with the resources that are necessary to connect with each other and the broader internet.  The Mesh-NOC will combine the roles of an SOC and NOC to assure the availability of technical resources to mesh-locals.  While offline access to materials is incredibly valuable to local meshes, interconnection allows for the knowledge sharing that captures the essence of what makes the internet such a great tool.   

## Motivations
A primary, and excessively large barrier to internet connectivity is the physical space at an IXP and the centrally provisioned resources such as network prefixes and an autonomous system number.  The Mesh-NOC will make available these resources to smaller meshes until the point at which they scale to needing their own.  

## Architecture
The NOC will be designed to function from a single datacenter (Virtualized or otherwise), but can be accessed in full from any location with network connectivity.  The model will be designed to be adopted by mesh locals as they scale up to needing their own local internet connection.
