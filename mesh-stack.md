## Overview  
The mesh stack aims to be an out of the box stack that can be run for a mesh local providing both local services, and connection resources to the internet and other meshes.   

## Project Goal
### Interconnection
While autoconfiguration networking is ideal for for mesh-locals, this architecture does not scale for interconnection.  There is an inherent need for some level of centralization when it comes to connection to the internet.   
### Local Service Stack
The local service stack will provide the following services:   

Organizational:  
- [x] [Website](thenextbillion.online)
- [ ] Volunteer intake 
- [ ] Customer Relations management
- [ ] Email Server 
- [ ] Events Page  
Collaborative:
- [ ] Chat - Matrix
- [ ] Voice Chat - PBX and Matrix
- [ ] Calendar Application  
- [ ] Secure File Storage - Nextcloud
- [ ] Collaborative Document Editing (Cryptpad)
- [ ] Fault Tolerant Messaging in a vein similar to [SSB](https://github.com/ssbc/secure-scuttlebutt).  
- [ ] Projects/issues/tracking
Technical:
- [ ] Network Statistics - Grafana
- [ ] Local Version Control Repositories - Gitlab
- [ ] Jupyter Notebook Server    
 

This list is a work in progress, and specific technologies have not been chosen in general. However, we are pretty set on Cryptpad and know one of the devs well.
